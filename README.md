# TicTacToe_8thLight
Greetings 8th Light! This is my unbeatable game of tic tac toe -- where the computer always wins!

This is a complete client-side application using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

First thing it prompts you for is choosing if player 1 is a human, you can click okay for yes or cancel for no. The second thing it asks is if player 2 is a human, you can click okay for yes, and cancel for no. Player 1 will always go first, so this is how you can choose who goes first (clicking cancel to player 1 makes the computer go first). If you are playing computer v computer it should always go to Stalemate, as it should continuously be blocking the other player from winning.
When playing a human, the computer will always win as instead of taking the chance to block the human, it will take the opportunity to win.
